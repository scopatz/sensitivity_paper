Abstract
========
Technology development and deployment decisions are justified by weighing their costs
against the expected benefits.  Multiple Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulation models 
have been devised, some with the aim of quantifying cycle-wide sensitivities to variations from 
base-case scenarios.  Base-case sensitivity studies often perturb only one parameter at a time, 
and only in the region around the initial value.  This paper details a sensitivity study methodology 
which applies entropy-based statistical methods of information theory to describe outcomes produced by 
an NFC model.  This supersedes past efforts at sensitivity and uncertainty analysis by allowing 
a much larger space to be explored.  Here, thirty independent fuel cycle parameters for a Fast Reactor-Light 
Water Reactor hybrid scenario are varied simultaneously and stochastically.  This fuel cycle schema was chosen 
as a well-known, sufficiently complex model; the underlying statistical methods could be applied to any cycle.
This study uses the uncertainty coefficient computed from contingency tables to represent the 
sensitivity of a technology-defining input to the response.  The response of interest here was 
taken to be the deep geologic repository capacity for a given realization of fuel cycle inputs.  
After computing the uncertainty coefficients, the inputs themselves are then sorted based on 
decreasing sensitivities.  Fast reactor used fuel plutonium separations were 
found to be most important to the cycle.  Furthermore, to represent input covariances (the effect of one 
input on the sensitivity of a second input to the response) a new measure is defined on three dimensional 
contingency tables.  This metric is the coefficient of variation of uncertainty coefficient of two 
dimensional slices of the original table.  Sorting by this sensitivity of sensitivity metric, 
the input pair of fast reactor americium separations together with high-level waste storage time 
were found to have the largest joint effect on the repository capacity.
